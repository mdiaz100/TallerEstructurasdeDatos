**1.** Given a string, find all possible palindromic partitions of given string.

**2.** The atoi() function takes a string (which represents an integer) as an argument and returns its value.

**3.** Given an integer, K. Generate all binary strings of size k without consecutive 1’s.

**4.** Given two positive integers n and k, print all increasing sequences of length k such that the elements in every sequence are from the first n natural numbers.

**5.** Given an array of integers, print a sum triangle from it such that the first level has all array elements. From then, at each level number of elements is one less than the previous level and elements at the level is be the Sum of consecutive two elements in the previous level.

**6.** Given an array, write functions to find the minimum and maximum elements in it.

**7.** Given two sorted arrays A and B, generate all possible arrays such that the first element is taken from A then from B then from A, and so on in increasing order till the arrays are exhausted. The generated arrays should end with an element from B.

**8.** Given a string find its first uppercase letter.

**9.** Given an input string of numbers, find all combinations of numbers that can be formed using digits in the same order.

**10.** Given a string calculate length of the string using recursion.
